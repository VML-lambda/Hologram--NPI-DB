# Noisy Phase Image Database (NPI-DB)

## Introduction
This repository contains the description of NPI-DB.  
NPI-DB conducted to evaluate the performance of Phase-distortion metrics for Hologram aim to a reliable phase-domain that strongly correlations with the NR-domain.  
Each sample within 2D NPI-DB comprises four images: **reference natural images**, **reference hologram images** generated from reference natural images, its corresponding **noisy hologram images**, and the respective **Numerical Reconstruction (NR) images**.  

## Description
### Noise types
We used a total of 13 distinct noise types were added to the reference phase images of hologram, comprising 7common noise types, 3 block-based noise types applied at the block level, and 3 compression noise types. For each noise type, we included 5 different noise levels, resulting in a substantial collection of 12,000 noisy phase images in the NPI-DB.

### 2D NPI-DB: 2K Phase-hologram database
We used reference natural images obtained from the [DIV2K](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014884) and [Unsplash2K](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/NTIRE/papers/Kim_Noise_Conditional_Flow_Model_for_Learning_the_Super-Resolution_Space_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf) datasets. 25 natural images were selected from each dataset, resulting in a total of 50 natural images.  
A total of 200 reference phase-hologram images were generated by four distinct phase-hologram generation methods, namely [DPAC](), [GS](), [SGD](), and [HoloNet](). The parameters used to generate the reference phase-hologram images are as follows: wavelenght of 638, 520, and 450nm, a propagation distance of 20cm, and a pixel pitch of 6.4um, These parameters were carefully selected to ensure accurate and consistent generation of the reference phase-hologram images accross the different phase-hologram generation methods. We used codes provided in [HoloNet]().
